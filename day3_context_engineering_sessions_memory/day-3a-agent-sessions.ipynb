Drug discovery is one of the most active and exciting areas for AI in healthcare, and there are **frequent and significant new developments**. Here are some of the key trends and recent advancements you'd likely find if you were looking at the absolute latest news:\n\n**Major Themes in Recent AI Drug Discovery News:**\n\n1.  **Accelerated Target Identification & Validation:**\n    *   **AI analyzing vast biological datasets:** This includes genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and electronic health records (EHRs) to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or too complex to uncover with traditional methods.\n    *   **Predicting protein structure and function:** Tools like **AlphaFold** (from DeepMind/Google) and similar AI models have revolutionized our ability to understand the 3D structures of proteins. This is crucial because protein function is intimately linked to its structure, and knowing this allows researchers to design drugs that can interact with specific proteins.\n    *   **Identifying novel disease mechanisms:** AI can help researchers understand the intricate pathways and molecular interactions that lead to disease, leading to the identification of better points for therapeutic intervention.\n\n2.  **De Novo Drug Design (Creating New Molecules):**\n    *   **Generative AI models:** These models are trained on vast libraries of existing molecules and can then generate entirely new molecular structures with desired properties (e.g., binding affinity to a target, solubility, low toxicity). This moves beyond just screening existing compounds to truly designing novel ones from scratch.\n    *   **\"Dreaming\" up new drugs:** Researchers are using AI to \"dream up\" molecules that might not have been conceived by human chemists, opening up new chemical spaces for drug development.\n\n3.  **Optimizing Drug Properties and Predicting Efficacy/Toxicity:**\n    *   **Predicting ADMET properties:** AI models are getting better at predicting Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) of potential drug candidates early in the process. This helps weed out compounds likely to fail due to poor pharmacokinetic profiles or safety concerns, saving significant time and money.\n    *   **Simulating clinical trial outcomes:** While still in its early stages, AI is being used to build predictive models that can simulate aspects of clinical trials, helping to identify patient populations most likely to respond or predict potential efficacy and safety signals before costly human trials.\n\n4.  **Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n    *   **Smart screening of existing libraries:** AI can quickly analyze known drugs and their mechanisms of action against new disease targets, identifying potential repurposing candidates much faster than manual methods. This is particularly relevant for rare diseases or rapidly emerging threats (like new viruses).\n\n5.  **AI in Specific Therapeutic Areas:**\n    *   **Oncology:** AI is heavily used to identify cancer targets, design personalized cancer therapies, and predict patient response to immunotherapy.\n    *   **Neurology:** AI is being applied to discover drugs for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's by understanding complex brain pathways.\n    *   **Infectious Diseases:** Rapid AI-driven drug discovery is crucial for combating antibiotic resistance and emerging infectious agents.\n\n**Examples of Recent News/Developments (General Concepts):**\n\n*   **Numerous AI-first biotech companies are reporting significant progress:** Companies like Insilico Medicine, Exscientia, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, and Atomwise are frequently in the news for striking deals with larger pharmaceutical companies, advancing drug candidates into clinical trials, or achieving key discovery milestones.\n*   **Specific drug candidates moving into human trials:** It's not uncommon to see announcements about AI-designed molecules entering Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials, signifying a tangible step forward.\n*   **New AI platforms and algorithms being released:** Researchers and companies are continuously developing and releasing more sophisticated AI tools for various aspects of drug discovery.\n*   **Collaboration announcements:** Major pharmaceutical giants are forming strategic partnerships with AI drug discovery firms to leverage their capabilities.\n\n**To get the *absolute* latest, you'd want to look at the news feeds of the companies and research institutions mentioned above, as well as major scientific journals and industry news sites like STAT News, Fierce Biotech, and Endpoints News.** The pace of innovation here is truly astounding!\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Okay, you're asking about the **second development** I mentioned in the context of AI in drug discovery. That was:\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design (Creating New Molecules)**\n\nThis is a truly groundbreaking area where AI isn't just analyzing existing data or optimizing known compounds, but is actively involved in **generating novel molecular structures** that have never existed before.\n\n**Here's a deeper dive into what \"De Novo Drug Design\" means and why it's so significant:**\n\n*   **What \"De Novo\" Means:** In Latin, \"de novo\" means \"from the beginning\" or \"anew.\" In drug discovery, it refers to the process of designing and synthesizing new molecules from scratch, rather than just modifying existing ones or screening large libraries of pre-made compounds.\n\n*   **The Traditional Approach vs. AI:**\n    *   **Traditional:** Historically, drug discovery relied heavily on serendipity, trial-and-error, and screening vast libraries of existing chemical compounds to find ones that might bind to a disease target. This was often a slow, expensive, and sometimes inefficient process.\n    *   **AI-driven De Novo Design:** AI, particularly generative AI models, can learn the \"rules\" of molecular chemistry and biology from massive datasets. It can then use this knowledge to propose entirely new molecular structures that are optimized for specific properties, such as:\n        *   **High binding affinity** to a particular disease target (like a protein involved in cancer).\n        *   **Good pharmacokinetic properties** (how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body).\n        *   **Low predicted toxicity.**\n        *   **Synthesizability** (meaning it's actually possible for chemists to create the molecule in a lab).\n\n*   **How it Works (Simplified):**\n    *   **Generative Models:** Think of AI models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). These models are trained on huge databases of known drugs and molecules.\n    *   **Learning the \"Language\" of Molecules:** They learn the complex relationships between a molecule's structure and its properties (both physical and biological).\n    *   **Generating New Candidates:** Once trained, these models can be given a \"prompt\" or a set of desired characteristics (e.g., \"design a molecule that binds strongly to protein X and has low predicted liver toxicity\"). The AI then generates molecular structures that are predicted to meet those criteria.\n    *   **Iterative Design:** Often, this is an iterative process. The AI proposes a molecule, researchers might analyze it and provide feedback, or the AI itself might refine its generation based on updated criteria or predictive models.\n\n*   **Why it's a Game Changer:**\n    *   **Explores Untapped Chemical Space:** AI can design molecules that are completely novel and exist outside of what human intuition or existing libraries might suggest. This opens up entirely new avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n    *   **Speed and Efficiency:** It can drastically shorten the time it takes to identify promising drug candidates. Instead of screening millions of compounds, AI can propose hundreds or thousands of highly optimized candidates in a fraction of the time.\n    *   **Personalization:** In the future, this could be applied to design drugs tailored to an individual's specific genetic makeup or disease subtype.\n    *   **Overcoming Challenges:** It can help design molecules that overcome existing limitations of drugs, such as resistance mechanisms or poor bioavailability.\n\n*   **Real-World Impact:** While still an evolving field, we are seeing companies use de novo design to:\n    *   Discover novel antibiotics to combat resistant bacteria.\n    *   Design targeted cancer therapies.\n    *   Develop treatments for rare genetic diseases.\n\n**In essence, de novo drug design powered by AI is like having an incredibly intelligent, tireless, and creative molecular architect working alongside human scientists, allowing us to build better, more effective medicines faster than ever before.** It represents a fundamental shift from \"finding\" drugs to \"designing\" them.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're right to ask about the key players, as this is a highly competitive and innovative space! Several companies are at the forefront of de novo drug design using AI.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
