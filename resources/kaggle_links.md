## Day1:
 Introduction to Al agents, taxonomy of agent capabilities, need for an Agent Ops discipline for reliability and governance, and the importance of agent interoperability and security through identity and constrained policies.

Codelabs include building your first AI agent and your first multi-agent system, using ADK, powered by Gemini, and giving it the ability to use Google Search to answer questions with up-to-date information. In the second codelab, the focus will be on multi-agent systems, how to create teams of specialized agents and explore different architectural patterns.

## Day2:
 Create external tools functions that allow an agent to perform actions or retrieve real-time data beyond its training set  and introduces best practices for designing effective tools are coverd. You'll learn about Model Context Protocol (MCP), highlighting its architectural components, communication layer, risks and enterprise readiness gaps.

The day codelabs covers creation of custom tools for my agents by turning my own Python functions into actions my agent can perform. MCP and implementation of long-running operations where an agent can pause tool calls while waiting for human approval, before resuming is developed.
